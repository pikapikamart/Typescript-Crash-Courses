# React with Typescript Crash Course 2021 - Laith Harb

Hi, this is the first crash course that I take from youtube.
This one is from Laith Harb. It is a 1 hour crash course, just a startup for beginners like me in typescript.

I intended to use this repository for typescript learning for me.
Thank you!
